# Dermatological Image Classification in Orange
## Overview
This project focuses on classifying dermatological conditions such as ringworm, vitiligo, and skin cancer using machine learning techniques. By leveraging image embeddings and predictive models, the project provides a reliable workflow for automated dermatological diagnostics. Built using the Orange data mining tool, it combines data visualization, clustering, and supervised learning to analyze medical images effectively.

## Features
  - Import and process dermatological images for analysis.
  - Extract numerical features using image embeddings.
  - Classify skin conditions with supervised models like Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes.
  - Visualize data relationships with hierarchical clustering.
  - Evaluate model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.
  - Generate insightful visualizations including confusion matrices, bar plots, scatter plots, and violin plots.

## Technologies Used
  - Orange: For data mining, workflow design, and visualization.
  - Machine Learning: Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes classifiers.
  - Image Embedding: For feature extraction from dermatological images.
  - Visualization Tools: Confusion Matrix, Bar Plot, Scatter Plot, Violin Plot.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of dermatological images representing three conditions: ringworm, vitiligo, and skin cancer. Images are preprocessed and embedded for classification.

## How It Works
1.Import dermatological images using the Orange workflow.
2.Extract image embeddings to transform images into numerical features.
3.Analyze data relationships using hierarchical clustering.
4.Train and test classification models like Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes.
5.Evaluate model performance with metrics and visualizations.
6.Generate predictions and insights for skin disease classification.

## Getting Started
1.Prerequisites
  - Install the Orange data mining tool.
